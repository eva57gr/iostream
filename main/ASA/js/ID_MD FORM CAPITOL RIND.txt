In the final file is the logic of the lines with columns 8
Now add the same logic but for column 10. 
The rows  are the same and the id is the same, the only difference in the id is that for column 8 it ends with 8 but for column 10 
it will end with 10.
And add the same logic but for column 9.
The only difference is that column 9 is an integer.
There must already be 3 logics in the final file.
One for column 8 and another for column 9 and another for column 10.
